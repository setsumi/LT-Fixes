# Sponsorship

This software is completely free and open-source. However, maintaining software is not easyâ€”development and upkeep require significant time and effort.

If you find this software helpful, we'd be honored if you could become a [sponsor](https://patreon.com/HIllya51). Your support will be the driving force behind the software's long-term maintenance.

If you encounter any issues, please check the user manual or search for video tutorials created by community contributors. You're also welcome to join my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ErtDwVeAbB) or submit an [issue](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator/issues) on GitHub to discuss with me.
