### Missing Important Components

Solution: Close antivirus software. If it cannot be closed (such as Windows Defender), add it to the trust list and then re-download.

Note: To achieve HOOK extraction of game text, it is necessary to inject Dll into the game. Files such as shareddllproxy32.exe/LunaHost32.dll implement this, and therefore are particularly likely to be considered as viruses. The software is currently automatically built by [Github Actions](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator/actions). Unless the Github server is infected, it is impossible to contain viruses, so it can be safely added to the trust list.

::: details For Windows Defender, the method is: “Virus & threat protection” -> “Exclusions” -> “Add or remove exclusions” -> “Add an exclusion” -> “Folder”, add Luna's folder to it
